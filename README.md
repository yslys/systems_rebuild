# systems_rebuild
This repository will contain multiple systems built from scratch.

### Motivation
Having been working on Linux device drivers and gem5, I realized that I am bad at getting started to contribute to large code bases. There is no excuse for the code bases being too complicated - all that is because I am bad at programming. To cope with my shortage, I decide to "rewrite" existing systems.

### Steps
1. Pick an existing system.
2. Read the corresponding paper, and take down some notes.
3. Find the earliest possible release of the system.
4. Read the code, and rewrite from scratch using the same programming language (not copy-paste).
5. Rebuild the system using another language (cpp/python). (This is optional)
6. Follow each later release, and add new features to it.

### Targets
1. Apache Hadoop \[[paper](https://storageconference.us/2010/Papers/MSST/Shvachko.pdf), [code](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/releases/tag/release-0.1.0), [misc](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.pdf) \]
2. Apache Spark \[[paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2016/cacm_apache_spark.pdf), [code](https://github.com/apache/spark/releases/tag/alpha-0.1)\]
3. MLFlow \[[paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2018/ieee_mlflow.pdf), [code](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.2.0)\]
